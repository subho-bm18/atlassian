'''
Vote algorightm - Given votes of candidates sort them by most votes received
First vote have highest weight and subsequent votes have weight-1 then previous vote
Input : [[A, B, C],
[A, C, D],
[D,A,C]]
Output : [A, D , C , B]

ðŸ†• New Problem:
Votes are weighted: First position gets the most points, second gets one less, etc.

The total score for each candidate is what determines the final rank.

New Problem Example
Input:
python
Copy
Edit
votes = [
    ["A", "B", "C"],
    ["A", "C", "D"],
    ["D", "A", "C"]
]
Weighting:
First position = 3 points

Second = 2 points

Third = 1 point

Tally:
Candidate	Total Points
A	3 + 3 + 2 = 8
B	2
C	1 + 2 + 1 = 4
D	1 + 3 = 4

So we get:
A: 8
C: 4
D: 4
B: 2
Break ties alphabetically between C and D â†’ C first.

âœ… Expected Output:

["A", "C", "D", "B"]
